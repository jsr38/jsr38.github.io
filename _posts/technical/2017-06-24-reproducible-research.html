<p>
These postings have come about as a result of an abandoned attempt to process and publish 
my notes contained within a proprietary system using a combination of a Python API and XML 
Stylesheet Transforms.  The solution was abandoned not because the task was particularly 
difficult but that it was inherently fragile due to it relying on what a third-party API 
would return when queried for content and that the API apparently made no guarantees about 
future changes.  It was also labourious to cater for each case of the custom markup elements
 in the transformation.
</p>

<p>
The motivation was to be able to selectively publish notes containing code including Latex
 markup to a public web site.  At the time, I was using a proprietary system as this seemed 
convenient and worthwhile to have the notes managed across multiple devices including mobile
 devices without resorting to distributed source control or other synchronisation means.  It
 transpired that when taking in to account the effort to reliably transform and publish from 
this system that the cost outweighed the benefit.

<p>
Also at the time it was not a concern of mine to integrate runnable code fragments and output 
of analysis in the published documents, however, on reflection and based on past experiences, 
it is clearly invaluable to do this for many reasons.  Just as the in the software world 
Test Driven Development provides reassurances of correctness and a formal method of documenting
 the intended function of code, a similar kind of reproducibility can be had when carrying 
out research work.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I was not previously aware of Emacs' org-mode and it seems hugely capable in respect of the 
stated objective and many others are clearly in agreement.  Org-mode allows text, graphics 
and code to all be edited and previewed in Emacs and offers a framework for publishing with
 numerous so-called back-ends for transforming documents into Latex and HTML.

The Jekyll parsing engine drives GitHub Pages which are a convenient way of linking version
